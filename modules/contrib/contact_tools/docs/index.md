# Contact Tools

[Drupal.org project](https://drupal.org/project/contact_tools) | [GitHub project](https://github.com/Niklan/contact_tools)

This module is pack of tools for working with Drupal 8 core Contact module forms. It's provide:

- AJAX support for contact forms on demand.
- Service to easy call contact form w/ and w/o AJAX support, generate link which opens form in modal window w/ and w/o AJAX.
- Text filter which allows to create simple links with modal form support.
- Twig functions to easy embed modal links or whole form in the template.
- Hooks to modify data on every step.

There is no UI for module. I don't see any reason for creating it right now. This tools are targeted for developers to use on demand, not globally.
